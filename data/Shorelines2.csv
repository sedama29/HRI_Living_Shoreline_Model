1,Bank height higher than 10 feet?,*,2,Seek expert advice on land use management.,,"The height of the bank between the shoreline and the upland can limit the effectiveness of shoreline management techniques. If the bank height is greater than 10ft, contacting an expert may be useful before proceeding. "
2,Is the shoreline defended?,3,7,,,Shoreline protection structures include bulkheads (vertical sea walls generally made of treated wood or steel that sit seaward of the shoreline with fill material on the landward side) and revetment or riprap (large boulder or concrete blocks that are placed on a gradient along the shoreline). 
3,"Does the shoreline have a retaining wall, seawall, other bulkhead feature?",5,4,,,"Retaining walls, sea walls, and bulkheads are vertical walls generally made of treated wood or steel that sit seaward of the shoreline with fill material on the landward side or may be secured directly to the shoreline. "
4,"Is there an articulated mat, alongshore riprap, or other revetment structure?",6,8,,,"Revetment or riprap are large boulder or concrete blocks that are placed on a gradient along the shoreline. Bank condition, tidal marsh presence, and construction access are all important factors to consider for revetment installation. Articulated concrete block mats are made of a matrix of individual concrete blocks placed along the shoreline to control erosion. These mats are sometimes infilled with stone or soil to allow for vegetation growth over time. They are often found along channels, shoreline restoration sites, and along boat ramps. "
5,"Is there a highly modified area (commericial or industrial areas, channel modification, or infrastructure) adjacent to shoreline?",*,11,Seek expert advice on highly modified areas,,"Highly modified areas include features such as commercial or industrial areas, channel modifications (canals or shipping lanes), or infrastructure directly adjacent to the shoreline (such as roads). Management options for this shoreline may be limited due to the presence of highly developed upland (e.g. commercial or industrial areas), channel modifications (e.g. canals or shipping lanes), or infrastructure directly adjacent to the shoreline (e.g. roads). Shoreline best management practices will depend on the need for and limitations posed by navigational needs and erosion control. Please seek advice from local resources such as the Texas General Land Office Permit Service Center, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Galveston Bay Foundation."

7,Does the shoreline have an existing breakwater?,10,9,,,"Breakwaters are offshore structures that sit shore-parallel, helping to reduce wave impact and erosion along the shoreline. They are generally made of rock, concrete, or oyster shell. "

10,Is a marsh present?,*,18,"No action needed if breakwater and marsh are in good shape, otherwise seek expert advice.",,"Tidal marshes are features comprised of wetland vegetation (primarily grasses and herbaceous plants rather than trees) that are well established. They can be found in upland areas and embayments, extensive features along open sections of a waterbody, or grow parallel to shorelines as fringe marshes. "
11,"Oysters, SAV, native marsh vegetation or cypress tress present?",*,12,Ecological conflicts. Seek regulatory advice,,"Management options for this shoreline may be limited by the presence of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) also known as seagrass, oysters, cypress swamp, or existing inter-tidal marsh. Please seek advice from local resources such as the Texas General Land Office Permit Service Center, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Galveston Bay Foundation."
12,Is a sand spit present?,*,13,Special geomorphic feature. Seek expert advice.,,"Long, narrow deposition of sand extending outward from the shoreline in the direction of longshore transport or tidal movement. The natural condition of shorelines with these features should be maintained for sediment movement that may be important for wetland, dune, and beach health. "
13,Is a beach present?,14,16,,,"Beaches are the region between the water line and the upland region, comprised of sand, gravel, or stones. They may be narrow or wide features but are persistent over tidal and seasonal cycles, thought they may be subject to erosion or accretion of sediment over time. "
14,Is there an existing groin field,15,19,,,"Groins are shore perpendicular permanent structures that are used to capture and retain sand between them along stretches of the shoreline. They are generally comprised of armorstone, concrete units or blocks, rock filled gabions, sheet pile, or grout filled tubes or bags. "
15,Is the beach wide(visible above mean tide)?,*,20,Do nothing. Nourish the beach as needed.,,A wide beach is one that is considered to have at least 10 feet of dry sand persistently visible above the high tide line. 
16,Is a marsh present?,17,20,,,"Tidal marshes are features comprised of wetland vegetation (primarily grasses and herbaceous plants rather than trees) that are well established. They can be found in upland areas and embayments, extensive features along open sections of a waterbody, or grow parallel to shorelines as fringe marshes. "
17,How much wave energy was the shoreline exposed to?,*,23,Hybrid Stabilization: high profile breakwater with marsh planting,,"The wave energy is dictated by the fetch (distance across open water over which the wind can blow and generate waves). Facing perpendicular to a shoreline, the fetch is the distance between the shoreline and the nearest landmass. The larger the fetch, the greater the possible wave energy. To estimate this, low exposure = 0-0.5 mile fetch, 0.5-2 mile exposure = moderate fetch, and >2 miles = high fetch. "

21,What is the nearshore water depth?,*,24,Seek expert advice before proceeding.,,Nearshore water depths are measured as the vertical distance between the surface of the water and the submerged surface. This depth is recorded in feet below the mean low water elevation (ie -4 ft MLW). Shallow water depths are considered those less than 3 ft at a distance of 30 ft from the upland bank and where offshore slopes are gradual. Deep water depths are those greater than 3 ft at a distance of 30 ft from the shoreline and where the offshore slope is steep.

23,Is there a permanent structure close to the water?,*,*,Hybrid Stabilization: low profile breakwater and marsh planting,Soft Stabilization: marsh planting,Breakwaters (shore parallel structures) or revetment sitting offshore but close to the shoreline can help defend the shore from wave energy and be backfilled with sediment and marsh plantings for a hybrid technique.

25,Is there a tidal creek present?,26,*,,Seek expert advice before proceeding.,A tidal creek is a narrow inlet or estuary that is affected by tides and is thus subject to varying salinity and exposure over the course of each tidal cycle.
